>>> a1,a2,a3,a4=12,144,3.14,'omega'  #4 variables with different data,also a string data type to give example of Concatenation
>>>a0=a4+2  #in general, strings cannot have mathematical operations performed on them 
>>>print(a0)
#Python 3.9.0 gives TypeError: cannot concatenate 'str' and 'int' objects on line 3
#but there is an operation called Concatenation using the plus (+) symbol when using 2 string objects or more
#Concatenation in terms of strings just joins the string data together (without any arithmetic addition performed)
#example as follows
>>>a=a4+'omega'+'zebra'   #here we are concatenating string and the answer will not be 2omegazebra
>>>print(a)               #concatenation joins things together like sun+flower=sunflower
omegaomegazebra
#Now some arithmetic operations and order of operation examples are below
>>> a5,a6=(a2/a1),(a2//a1)   #performing division & floor division
>>> print(a5,a6)   #also division will keep the remainder that is why we still have 12.0 and not 12,while floor division gives only integer value
12.0 12  
>>> a7=a1+a3    
#here we can combine an integer 12+3.14=15.14,thereby combining an integer and a float and it gives a float answer
>>> print(a7)
15.14
>>> a8,a9=(a1*a1),(a2**a2)  #a8 is a simple multiplication (12*12),while a9 will be a huge exponentiation answer (144^144)
>>> print (a8,a9)

>>> a10=a8-a2+a8%a2  #subtraction and modulus.So,a10 =144-144+144%144=0
>>> print(a10)
0
>>> #now lets look at 2 little difficult mathematical expressions further below to look at order of operation
>>> a11=16-2*5//3+1        #expression#1-it follows the order of operation rule called PEDMAS
>>> #above arithmetic expression is evaluated as (2*5) first, then (10 // 3), then (16-3), and then (13+1)
>>> print (a11)

>>> a12=2**2**3*3
>>> #expression#2-similarly here by following order of operations we should have 2**2**3 which is 2^2^3=256 and then 258*3=768

768
